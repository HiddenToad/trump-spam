## spam trump's new site truthsocial with selenium and geckodriver

### calling all trump haters! trump has made a social network (truthsocial.com). in the terms of service, it states that users may not "disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Site." anyone who thinks that is ridiculous and restraining, read on!

### trump's new site's homepage has a mailing list. it has shitty email confirmation and no spam prevention or ratelimiting! let's take advantage of that while we still can.


## dependencies:
  * firefox
  * python3
  * selenium
  * geckodriver in your System32 directory (or linux PATH)


### usage is simple: python trumpspam.py


# NOW LET'S TAKE THIS DOWN!!!
